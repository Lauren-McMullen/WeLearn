## 🎓 Project Description

WeLearn is a accessbile tutoring Android mobile application prototype created for the 24-hour cmd-f hackathon in Vancouver, BC. The app was motivated by our team's desire to create a better way for students to get academic help. Office hours are often over crowded, private tutoring is expensive, and solo study sessions can be lonely and overwhelming! What if we could create an application where every student is both a learner AND a teacher?

- ✔️ More tutors would be available to student learners seeking help
- ✔️ Student tutors can engage with their course content and increase confidence by helping their peers (hello, Protege Effect)
- ✔️ Track your study sessions and stats

At WeLearn, we believe that we never stop learning, and that everyone has knowledge worth sharing. 

## 🖥️ Tech Stack

WeLearn was build using Java and Android Studio. Our prototype was created using Figma.

## 🔎 Looking Ahead

Given the 24-hour time limit of our hackathon project, we still have a lot of ideas about what WeLearn could become! Here are just a few of our future goals with the project:

- Integrate a functioning backend for suer accounts
-  Utilize the MappedIn API markers and wayfinding to help students connect with other students for a cycle of teaching and learning sessions
- Develop rating system so tutors can be judged by students
- Create a tutor summary when tutors check in so they can specify what they’re teaching and why they feel like they’re good at it


## 📱 Mobile App Photo Gallery

To better demostrate the intended user experience, the WeLearn video demo uses our Figma prototype. The images below are all a part of the developed application.
